🌱 Habit Plant

Small TypeScript project where habits are represented as plants.
Each habit grows when you practice it and has a mood based on its growth level.

This project was built to practice core TypeScript concepts such as classes, interfaces, enums, and basic CLI interaction.

✨ Features:
Each plant has:
a growth level (0–100)
a mood (sad, okay, happy)
you can grow a habit by interacting through the terminal.
I used simple command-line input using Node’s readline.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
TypeScript
Node.js
ts-node (for development)
